# cranlogs 2.1.2

* Fix `cran_downloads` and prevent it from failing with many packages:
  https://github.com/r-hub/cranlogs/issues/56
* Speed up `cran_downloads` with parallelisation.
* Add new unit test for `cran_downloads` with lots of packages.
* Remove `dontrun{}` from `cran_downloads` and `cran_top_downloads` examples.
  Unclear why this was here?
* New support function: `message_parallel`, `split_batches`
* Replace travis (failing)  and pkgdown with `rworkflows`.
* Update Authors in *DESCRIPTION* to reflect contribution, make fields explicit.
* Add *node_modules$* to *.Rbuildignore*.

# cranlogs 2.1.1

* New function `cranlogs_badge()` to construct the Markdown string of a
  badge for the README.

* Update the definition of the argument values "last-day", "last-week" and
  "last-month" to make them consistent with the database: "last-day" is
  the last day for which data is available, "last-week" 6 days prior to
  that last day with data, "last-month" 29 days prior to that last day
  with data.

* Drop row names after reordering which avoids having meaningless row
  names (@patperry, #23)

* Fix R download counts if a day is missing data (e.g. 2015-08-23).

# cranlogs 2.1.0

# cranlogs 2.0.0
